The `Hammerhead` can be easily run with the following command.

```shell
hammerhead --ref ecoli.fa --read test.fastq.gz --min_depth 5 --min_depth_strand 3
```



**Note:** The arguments used in this command were for demonstration purposes only (the read coverage of  data was too shallow) and may not reflect the optimal settings for your dataset. It is generally recommended to use the default arguments when you have sufficient read coverage, typically considered to be more than 50-fold coverage.
